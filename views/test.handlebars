              <p  style="font-size: 14pt">My name is Evan Cleary. I was born in an outskirts of Philadelphia called Ambler, PA. I
                am one of 6
                siblings in
                my family. I have 1 twin, 2 brothers, 3 sisters and 60 cousins. All of them are older
                then me,
                including my twin.
                She lives far away now.</p>

            <div class="col">
              <p  style="font-size: 14pt">  I graduated college in 2014 where I was President of the service organization I was a
                part of. I
                then was
                selected to be a Business developer for a Bio-Tech start-up. I was tasked with running
                the
                seed-funding initiative, which involved presenting the prototype and business plan to
                Angel
                Investors. I later
                went on to start my own company which is steady and growing. Though this particular
                business, while
                profitable, is
                not fulfilling my creative aspirations.</p>
              <p  style="font-size:  14pt">Growing up I've had many ideas for utilizations of technology. I have notebooks of ideas
                stacked in
                my home, but
                never the tools or means to execute on them. I plan to learn everything I can about
                computer
                programming so I can
                build more start-up companies. I hope to make many different web applications and mobile
                applications with my
                skillset to start to build a solid holding company that generates revenue from these
                minor
                applications.</p>
              <p  style="font-size: 14pt">Then, I have one idea in particular that I believe can be very popular. So I intend to
                work as hard
                as I can
                until I develop the skillset necessary to carry out that idea.</p>
